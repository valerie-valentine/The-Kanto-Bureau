# The-Kanto-Bureau

You're a job coordinator in a world where Pok√©mon help out with everyday tasks: from delivering mail to baking cupcakes. Assign Pok√©mon to odd jobs based on their strengths. In return, they gain experience, earn rewards, and unlock new opportunities.

## Planning & Design Stage

This project is in the early design phase. Below are some of the tools I'm using to help plan out The Kanto Bureau:

- üìã [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/0VQ2TTbU/the-kanto-bureau) ‚Äì feature planning, MVP outline, task board, and game logic
- üóÇ [Canva Database Schema Mock-up](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGrOfx3zqs/8TBFQYDq7TEkTv8vKBtn2Q/view?utm_content=DAGrOfx3zqs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h2de697ac5e) ‚Äì Initial ERD + data relationships

Please stay tuned! More to come as I move from design to development.

## MVP
Objective: A mini-game where players manage Pok√©mon job assignments based on their strengths.

Overview: This project is a web-based mini-game for Pok√©mon fans where players take on the role of a Job Coordinator. Inspired by the Pok√© Jobs feature in Sword & Shield, the game lets users assign Pok√©mon to various odd jobs based on their individual stats.

The goal is to create a fun, lightweight experience that blends strategy and nostalgia. As Pok√©mon complete jobs, they earn experience, rewards, and unlock new tasks.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Javascript, React, Typescript
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- Third-Party API: [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

Requirements:
- Display a list of available Pok√©mon and jobs
- Allow users to assign Pok√©mon to jobs based on type/stats
- Return job results (e.g. XP gained, rewards earned)
- Create backend routes for Pok√©mon, jobs, and assignments
- Store Pok√©mon, jobs, and assignments in a PostgreSQL database
- Seed Pok√©mon data using the Pok√©API
- Build a simple React UI for selecting jobs and assigning Pok√©mon

Stretch Goals:
- User accounts / save progress
- Pok√©mon evolution based on xp
- Job types with bonuses or challenges
- Raspberry Pi integration
- Custom team building
