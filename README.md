# The-Kanto-Bureau

You're a job coordinator in a world where PokÃ©mon help out with everyday tasks: from delivering mail to baking cupcakes. Assign PokÃ©mon to odd jobs based on their strengths. In return, they gain experience, earn rewards, and unlock new opportunities.

## ðŸ§  Planning & Design Stage

This project is in the early design phase. Below are some of the tools I'm using to help plan out The Kanto Bureau:

- ðŸ“‹ [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/684499fc9a8ddecbf6e04f6e/ATTIf0c521cf804d153030d606ae5d0f937e1CE0D206/the-kanto-bureau) â€“ feature plannng, MVP outline, task board, and game logic
- ðŸ—‚ [Canva Database Schema Mock-up](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGrOfx3zqs/8TBFQYDq7TEkTv8vKBtn2Q/view?utm_content=DAGrOfx3zqs&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h2de697ac5e) â€“ Initial ERD + data relationships

Please stay tuned! More to come as I move from design to development.
